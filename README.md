To run appliaction `cd` into the parent directory and run the following command `./gradlew bootrun` on unix systems. On Windows based systems you have to run `gradlew.bat bootrun` (Please note I have not tested this as I don't have access to a windows based system)

Once the application has started, please visist ***[http://localhost:8080/api/v1](http://localhost:8080/api/v1)*** to navigate the API through the HAL browser. Alternatively you can interact with the API through a tool like Postman.

API has GET, POST, PUSH and DELETE commands.

Thanks,
Cathal
